# Snakey Snake Game

A classic Snake game built using Python's turtle graphics. Control the snake, eat food, grow larger, and avoid collisions with the walls and your own body to keep the game going.

## Description

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game that shipped with the Nokia 3310. The player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eats food to grow larger, and must avoid running into the walls or itself. The game keeps track of the player's score and ends when the snake collides with a wall or its own body.

## Features

- **Scoring System**: Keeps track of the player's score, which increases each time the snake eats food.
- **Snake Growth**: The snake grows in length each time it eats food, making the game progressively more challenging.
- **Collision Detection**: Detects collisions with the walls and the snake's own body, triggering a game over.
- **Game Over Functionality**: Ends the game and displays a game over message when the snake collides with a wall or itself.
- **Responsive Controls**: Use the 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D' keys to control the direction of the snake's movement.

## How to Play

1. Run the game script.
2. Use the 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D' keys to move the snake up, left, down, and right respectively.
3. Eat the food that appears on the screen to grow the snake and increase your score.
4. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.
5. The game ends when a collision occurs. Your final score will be displayed.

Enjoy playing Snakey Snake!
